# Password-generator-cha-3(live link included):https://marianellag1.github.io/Password-generator-cha-3/
In this challenge 3, with the help of TA Paul, I was able to make a password generator.
The generator includes questions to the user, asking to choose whether the user wants to add upper-case, lower-case, special characters or numbers in this random password generator.
The user will also get to choose how many characters they will get from a range of 8-128 characters, with an alert indicating if it is below or above the approved amount of characters to choose from.
The user, if completed correctly and choose how they wish to receive the password, the password will pop up accordingly to chosen answers.
If the user chooses cancel for all, and answer will pop up indicating user MUST choose atlest one for password generator to work.
